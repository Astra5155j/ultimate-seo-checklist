# HTMLElements - SEO Checklist

Tags are small snippets of HTML coding that tell engines how to properly “read” your content. In fact, you can vastly improve search engine visibility by adding SEO tags in HTML.


When a search engine’s crawler comes across your content, it takes a look at the HTML tags of the site. This information helps engines like Google determine what your content is about and how to categorize the material.


Some of them also improve how visitors view your content in those search engines. And this is in addition to how social media uses content tags to show your articles.


In the end, it’s HTML tags for SEO that will affect how your website performs on the Internet. Without these tags, you’re far less likely to really connect with an audience.

## Use Title Tags

Perhaps one of the most important HTML tags for SEO is that of the title. This is the label of your content and how searches see your page in Google and Bing. Every result you see in a search engine is derived from the title tag.


```
<title>About | Fossbarrow</title>
<title>Home | Fossbarrow</title>
```
## Use Body Tags

The <body> tag defines the document's body.
The <body> element contains all the contents of an HTML document, such as headings, paragraphs, images, hyperlinks, tables, lists, etc.
 
## The href Attribute

The <a> tag defines a hyperlink. The href attribute specifies the URL of the page the link goes to: <a href= www.Google.com>Google</a>
  
## The src Attribute

The <img> tag is used to embed an image in an HTML page. The src attribute specifies the path to the image to be displayed:  <img src="Github_Logo.jpg">
