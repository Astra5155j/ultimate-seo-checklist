# Contributing

Contributions are **welcome** and will be fully **credited**.

We accept contributions via Pull Requests.


## Pull Requests

- **Create feature branches** - Don't ask us to pull from your master branch.

- **One pull request per feature** - If you want to do more than one thing, send multiple pull requests.

- **Send coherent history** - Make sure each individual commit in your pull request is meaningful. If you had to make multiple intermediate commits while developing, please [squash them](http://www.git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Rewriting-History#Changing-Multiple-Commit-Messages) before submitting.

## Guide

2. Create your Seo Tips Branch (`git checkout -b chore/AmazingTip`)
3. Commit your Changes (`git commit -m 'Add some AmazingTip'`)
4. Push to the Branch (`git push origin feature/AmazingTip`)
5. Open a Pull Request


**Happy coding**!
